# CMake Includes for Pamplejuce

Hi there!

Why is this its own git submodule?

It's to help projects pull in the lastest changes from Pamplejuce. To prevent copy-n-pasting.

## Update at your own risk. 

As of 2023, Pamplejuce is still being changed around a bunch, with the goal of being a better and better ecosystem for developers.

That means there could be breakage when you pull. See the CHANGELOG.
